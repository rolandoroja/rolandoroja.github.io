  subtitle: "Public elevator – Mechanical design & installation documentation",

  // Expanded overview / intro (multiline)
  overview: `
The Obelisco de Buenos Aires is one of the most iconic landmarks of the city, inaugurated in 1936 and located at its historic center.

In 2022, the company where I worked was awarded the public tender to design and build a panoramic elevator inside the Obelisk, allowing public access to its viewpoint for the first time. Due to the monument being completely hollow, the project scope extended beyond the elevator itself: a fully self-supporting steel structure had to be designed and installed to house the elevator system, along with an emergency staircase wrapping around it.

This internal structure needed to be structurally independent, precisely adapted to the existing geometry, and assembled inside a highly constrained space. I had the opportunity to actively participate in the project, contributing across design, documentation, coordination, and visualization tasks throughout multiple stages of development.

  // What I did (expanded)
  highlights: [
    "3D modeling of the complete project, including assemblies and individual components of the self-supporting steel structure and elevator system",
    "Preparation of all fabrication and assembly drawings for workshop production and on-site installation",
    "Generation of CAM-ready DWG files for laser cutting of steel plates and profiles",
    "Participation in material selection proposals, space optimization studies, installation sequencing, and material access planning on site",
    "Calculation and verification of chemical anchors using Hilti software to ensure structural compliance",
    "Creation of technical renders using Autodesk Inventor for project presentations and progress reviews",
    "Development of video renders using Twinmotion to visually communicate project advances",
    "Material quantity calculations and optimization for the entire project (steel plates, profiles, tubes, metal meshes, fasteners, and accessories)",
    "Preparation of detailed installation and assembly instructions",
    "Follow-up and coordination of fabrication processes and material tracking for all major assemblies",
